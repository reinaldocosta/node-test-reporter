# Repo to showcase some actions

## Linting

In some cases, our projects are not being linted, or the linting tool stop working in the middle of the project. 
To help up with that, we can run our Lint in the actions instead of having hooks. 

This action help us in two great ways:
- Annotating the linting issue on the PR. 

- Fixing auto. some linting issues
